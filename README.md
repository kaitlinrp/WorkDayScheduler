# Work Day Scheduler


We have created a basic task organizer to keep track of your work day tasks which in turn will allow you to be more productive. Managing your time at work can be the difference between getting home on time or working late at the office. This tool will allow you to stay on top of your tasks, keep your boss happy, and in turn get home in time to cook yourself a homecooked meal.

Press "save" after each task to keep your tasks in your list if you refresh the page. Reminder that if you would like to delete a task after completing it, you can erase the tasks and save the empty space. 

Enjoy!
